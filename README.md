# Customer-Churn


"I developed a customer churn prediction model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with TensorFlow. The project involved comprehensive data preprocessing, including data cleaning, feature scaling with MinMaxScaler, and one-hot encoding using get_dummies for categorical variables. After training the model, I achieved an accuracy of 83.88% and evaluated the performance using a confusion matrix to understand the model's predictive capabilities. This project enhanced my expertise in deep learning, model evaluation, and applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve business challenges."
